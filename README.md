# ☁️ Cloud Cost Optimizer

Cloud Cost Optimizer is an AI-assisted, CLI-based tool that generates **synthetic cloud billing data** and produces **cost optimization recommendations** for software projects based on their requirements. The project demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be integrated into cloud cost modeling and analysis workflows.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/vasu-2004/cloud-cost-Optimizer.git
cd cloud-cost-Optimizer
```

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

API token:
```
create a file named .env in the root directory
and add this line
HF_API_TOKEN={YOUR_HF_API_TOKEN_TO_BE_PASTED_HERE}
```

Run the application:

```
python main.py
```

---

## 🖥️ CLI Workflow

Running `main.py` launches the following interactive menu:

```
Cloud Cost Optimizer
1. Enter new project description
2. Run Complete Cost Analysis
3. View Recommendations
4. Exit
Select option:
```

### Step 1️⃣: Extract Project Profile

* Select option **1**
* Paste the project description **in a single line**
* Output generated:

  * `data/project_profile.json`

---

### Step 2️⃣: Generate Synthetic Billing & Cost Analysis

* Select option **2**
* Generates realistic, cloud-agnostic synthetic billing records
* Performs cost analysis and optimization
* Outputs generated:

  * `data/mock_billing.json`
  * `data/cost_optimization_report.json`

---

### Step 3️⃣: View Recommendations

* Select option **3**
* Displays summarized cost-saving recommendations in the CLI

## 🧪 Sample Project Description

Use the following sample input for testing:

> We are developing a cloud-hosted SaaS application for small and medium businesses to manage inventory, sales, and supplier records. The platform is expected to support approximately 3,000–5,000 active users per month. The backend will be built using Python FastAPI, with a React-based frontend. Data will be stored in PostgreSQL, along with object storage for product images and documents. The system will be deployed on a public cloud with basic monitoring and alerting, focusing on scalability, high availability, and cost efficiency within a limited monthly budget.

---

## 📂 Sample Artifacts

Sample output files generated by the system can be found in the `sample_artifacts/` directory of this repository.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Acknowledgements

ChatGPT was used as a programming assistant to help design and write portions of the project code, including prompt structuring and LLM output validation. The tool supported faster development, while the final implementation, testing, and integration were performed independently.

## 📌 Notes

* Ensure required API tokens are properly configured before running the project
* Always paste the project description as **one single line** in the CLI
