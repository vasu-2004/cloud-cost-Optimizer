We are developing a cloud-hosted SaaS application for small and medium businesses to manage inventory, sales, and supplier records. The platform is expected to support approximately 3,000–5,000 active users per month. The backend will be built using Python FastAPI, with a React-based frontend. Data will be stored in PostgreSQL, along with object storage for product images and documents. The system will be deployed on a public cloud with basic monitoring and alerting, focusing on scalability, high availability, and cost efficiency within a limited monthly budget.
